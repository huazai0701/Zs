## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contract Features

#### Core Functions
```solidity
// Basic ERC20 functions
function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public returns (bool)
function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) public returns (bool)
function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) public returns (bool)

// ERC20Permit functions
function permit(address owner, address spender, uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public
function nonces(address owner) public view returns (uint256)

// Governance functions
function burn(uint256 amount) external
function burnFrom(address account, uint256 amount) external
```

#### Security Features
- **ReentrancyGuard**: Prevents reentrancy attacks
- **Ownable**: Secure ownership management
- **Pausable**: Emergency pause functionality
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions

### Token Distribution
- **Total Supply**: 10,000,000 RBO
- **Decimals**: 18
- **Distribution**:
  - 70% - Owner allocation
  - 20% - Marketing wallet
  - 10% - Liquidity wallet
